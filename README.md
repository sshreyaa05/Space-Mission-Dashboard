# Space-Mission-Dashboard
## Problem Statement
## The space mission aims to explore and gather data from a celestial body (e.g., a planet, moon, or asteroid) using advanced space probes and instruments. The primary objective could be to study its geology, atmosphere, magnetic field, or search for signs of past or present life.
## Methodology
## 1. Implement monitoring systems within Power BI to track mission progress, detect anomalies, and trigger alerts for immediate attention. 
## 2. This ensures that mission control can respond promptly to critical situations.
## Here we have gained the interactive visuals from the raw data :
